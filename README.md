# Project Overview

This project is a modern web application built with Next.js. It features a responsive front‑end design based on a component‑driven architecture. The current build focuses on frontend implementation with plans for further backend integration.

## Key Features

- **Next.js Based**: Enables server‑side rendering and efficient routing.
- **Responsive Design**: User experience optimized across devices.
- **Dynamic Components**: Features components like a conditional navigation bar that adapts based on the route.
- **Future Expansion**: Placeholder for upcoming backend integrations and additional features.

## Current Focus

- Building a robust frontend with modern React patterns.
- Employing a component‑based layout (e.g., conditional rendering for sign‑in and sign‑up pages).
- Ensuring clean separation between client and server components.

## Roadmap

- **Backend Integration**: Detailed backend services will be implemented and documented later.
- **Feature Enhancements**: Continuous improvements to the UI and component architecture.
